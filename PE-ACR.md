**Here are the steps on how to access a private ACR with a VM, assuming you're using Azure:**

**Prerequisites:**

- An Azure subscription
- An Azure virtual network (VNet)
- An Azure Container Registry (ACR) in Standard or Premium tier
- A VM in the same VNet or a peered VNet
- Azure CLI installed on the VM
- Docker installed on the VM

**Steps:**

1. **Create a private endpoint for the ACR:**
   - In the Azure portal, go to your ACR.
   - Under **Networking**, select **Private Endpoints**.
   - Click **+ Add**.
   - Choose the subscription, resource group, and VNet where your VM resides.
   - Select the **private link service** and **subnet**.
   - Click **Create**.

2. **Approve the private endpoint connection (if required):**
   - If the ACR requires approval, you'll need to manually approve the connection in the ACR's **Pending Private Endpoint Connections** tab.

3. **Enable private DNS zone integration for the ACR (optional but recommended):**
   - In the ACR's **Networking** section, under **Private DNS Zones**, click **+ Integrate with private DNS zone**.
   - Select the private DNS zone associated with your VNet.
   - Click **Integrate**.

4. **Install Azure CLI and Docker on the VM (if not already installed):**
   - Follow the official instructions to install Azure CLI and Docker on your VM.

5. **Connect to the ACR from the VM:**
   - SSH into your VM.
   - Use the Azure CLI to log in to the ACR:
     ```bash
     az acr login --name <acr-name>
     ```
   - Pull an image from the ACR:
     ```bash
     docker pull <acr-name>.azurecr.io/<image-name>:<tag>
     ```

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Authentication:**
   - Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for managed identities or service principals.
   - For individual users, create an ACR token.
- **Firewall rules:**
   - Ensure firewall rules allow traffic between the VM and ACR.
- **Virtual network peering:**
   - If the VM and ACR reside in different VNets, peer the VNets.
- **ACR service endpoint:**
   - Optionally, create an ACR service endpoint for more granular control.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you encounter issues, check network connectivity, firewall rules, DNS settings, and authentication details.
- Use tools like `ping` and `nslookup` to verify connectivity and DNS resolution.
- Refer to Azure documentation for troubleshooting tips.
